# Asynchronous global types implementation
The project is implemented with SWI-Prolog version 8.0.3 and 64 bits.
The code is based on libraries
* coinduction
* apply
* plunit

To use predicates you have to execute the command
```
[global_types].
```
in the same directory of the file *global_types.pl*.

To execute the test you have to execute the commands

1. ``` [test].```
1. ``` run_tests.```

in the same directory of both the files.
